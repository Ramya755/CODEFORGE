CodeForge 🎮
CodeForge is a gamified Flutter application designed for beginners and early intermediate learners to learn programming through interactive games instead of heavy theory.

The goal is simple: learn coding the way people love today — through games.

🧠 Problem It Solves
Many beginners give up on coding because learning often starts with long and abstract theoretical explanations.
CodeForge replaces this with learning-by-playing, making programming concepts engaging, practical, and easier to retain.

🚀 How CodeForge Works
Choose a Programming Language
(C, Python, Java, and more)

Select Topics & Subtopics
Each language is divided into structured topics such as Variables, Loops, and Functions, further broken into subtopics.

Level-Based Learning

Each subtopic contains 15 progressive levels
Levels unlock sequentially to ensure concept clarity
AI-Powered Concept Explanation

After completing a level, users experience an AI-driven conversation
The AI plays both student and teacher roles
Covers common beginner doubts (e.g., “What are loops?”)
Game-Based Challenges

Mini-games like Snake & Ladders, Card Games, and Racing Games
Losing a game triggers coding-based MCQs
Correct answers improve scores and reinforce learning
